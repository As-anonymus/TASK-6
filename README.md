# TASK-6
This is a project for recruitments of DSC.
It is a canavas where one can draw any thing using any color.
One can also download their drawings.

Some of the shortcomings of the project--
a.The strokes are not smooth rather they are having points just like being made up of several lines rather that a smooth clean curve.
b.No option to add custom made shapes(like circle,square).
c.The tool bar has not been made responsive properly(it is'nt under 1200*950px).
